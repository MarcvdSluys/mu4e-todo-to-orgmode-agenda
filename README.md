# mu4e-todo-to-orgmode-agenda

This bash script looks in my mu4e Todo mail folders, and puts the email subjects as headlines in my Orgmode
todo list.

I have several email accounts (in this example `Private` and `Work`), which are subdirectories of the main
mail directory `$MAILDIR`.  My todo email folders are all called `TodoL` (L indicating a Local folder) and are
subsubdirectories of `$MAILDIR`.  The Orgmode file used to save the output is called `~/.org/Email.org`.
